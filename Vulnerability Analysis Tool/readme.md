# Vulnerability Analysis Tool

A Python-based tool to analyze system vulnerabilities by performing port scanning, banner grabbing, and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) lookup. This tool is designed to help identify potential security risks in systems or networks.

---

## Features

1. **Port Scanning**:

   - Scans open ports on the target system.

2. **Banner Grabbing**:

   - Extracts service information from open ports to identify running applications.

3. **CVE Lookup**:

   - Matches detected services with known vulnerabilities using the CVE database.

4. **Report Generation**:
   - Generates a detailed report of findings in plain text format.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/4gnim/vulnerability_analysis_tool.git
   cd vulnerability_analysis_tool
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed.

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python vuln_analyzer.py
   ```

2. Input the target IP address or hostname when prompted.

3. The tool will:
   - Scan open ports.
   - Grab service banners from open ports.
   - Lookup CVEs for identified services.
   - Generate a vulnerability report in the `reports/` folder.
