# Usage Guide

## Wi-Fi Scanning

This feature scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks and displays the following information:

- SSID (network name)
- Signal strength (RSSI)
- Encryption type (WEP, WPA, WPA2)

### Steps:

1. Connect your NodeMCU to the computer.
2. Upload the `wifi_scanner.cpp` script from `src/wifi scanner/` using the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to view the output.

## Device Monitoring

This feature captures packets to identify connected devices based on their MAC addresses.

### Steps:

1. Connect your NodeMCU to the computer.
2. Upload the `device_monitor.cpp` script from `src/device monitor/` using the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to view captured data.

## Deauthentication Testing

This feature sends deauthentication packets to simulate an attack and test network resilience. **Use this only on authorized networks.**

### Steps:

1. Connect your NodeMCU to the computer.
2. Upload the `deauth_test.cpp` script from `src/deauth test/` using the Arduino IDE.
3. Modify the target MAC address in the script before uploading, if needed.
4. Open the Serial Monitor to confirm the action.

## Ethical Usage

- Ensure you have explicit permission to test the network.
- Do not use this tool for illegal activities or to harm others.
- This tool is intended for educational purposes only.
