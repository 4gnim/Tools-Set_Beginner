# Wi-Fi Penetration Testing Toolkit

This project is a Wi-Fi Penetration Testing Toolkit built using NodeMCU ESP8266. It is designed to scan and analyze Wi-Fi networks and devices, helping you evaluate the security of your own network (or one for which you have explicit permission). **This tool must be used ethically and within the boundaries of the law.**

## Features

- **Wi-Fi Scanning**: Detect available Wi-Fi networks, including SSID, signal strength, and encryption type (WEP, WPA, WPA2).
- **Device Monitoring**: Track connected devices using MAC addresses.
- **Deauthentication Testing**: Simulate a deauthentication attack to test network resilience (only with explicit permission).
- **Activity Logging**: Save test results and findings for further analysis.

## Components

- NodeMCU ESP8266
- USB Cable
- Computer with Arduino IDE
- A Wi-Fi network for testing (owned or permitted)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Add the NodeMCU ESP8266 board to the Arduino IDE:
   - Go to **File** > **Preferences**.
   - Add the following URL to the "Additional Board Manager URLs":
     ```
     http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
     ```
   - Open **Tools** > **Board** > **Boards Manager**, search for "ESP8266" and install it.

### Installation

1. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
2. Upload the desired script (Wi-Fi Scanning, Device Monitoring, or Deauthentication Testing) to your NodeMCU.

## Usage

### Wi-Fi Scanning

The script scans nearby Wi-Fi networks and prints the SSID, signal strength (RSSI), and encryption type to the Serial Monitor.

### Device Monitoring

The script uses promiscuous mode to capture packets and analyze MAC addresses of connected devices. Results are printed in the Serial Monitor.

### Deauthentication Testing

The script sends deauthentication packets to simulate an attack and test network security. **This feature must be used responsibly and only on authorized networks.**
